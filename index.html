  <h1>Similarties Between the Two Teaching Styles</h1>
  <p>
   In both of these videos, the primary goal of the person speaking is to examine how to best create an environment for learning. 
   Dweck takes a more formal approach, focused on classroom settings, while Muller explains his creative choices as the creator of an 
   educational Youtube channel. What both have in common is the idea that the act of learning involves much more than interaction with 
   the material.

  In both learning strategies, the key is to put the learner in a mindset where the information will be more memorable. Dweck makes 
  this the core of her philosophy. She believes that the learner should make a conscious effort to focus on the methods rather than 
  the result, and that once the student is more intent on learning the material rather than getting high scores on tests, they will 
  be more likely to retain the information. Muller goes about this more subtly. Rather than tell his audience (the viewers of his 
  videos) exactly what to look for, he leads them on a journey of thinking through the problem, which parallels the interviews in 
  the videos. By hearing other people’s (sometimes humorous) answers, the viewer engages with the material and compares it to his 
  or her own beliefs. This leads to a payoff at the end when the answer is finally revealed, and by this point the viewer can put 
  the answer in a context of preconceived beliefs.

  Both strategies achieve the same goal: giving the learner a reason to care about learning. Without a reason to learn beyond 
  “it’s what I’m supposed to do,” it’s extremely difficult to hold on to newfound knowledge in any meaningful way. By manipulating 
  the way in which we learn, we can achieve success in ways that have lasting impacts.

  <h1>In Contrast to Another Popular Strategy</h1>
  <p>
  Anyone who has gone through school has at some point had to deal with rote learning. Memorization for memorization's sake, with minimal
  context for the material. It's difficult and unrewarding, and runs in direct contrast to the strategies described by Dweck and Muller.
  The boredom associated with rote learning is awful for the mindset of the student, with consequences described in Dweck's video. It also
  has no meaningful connection to any other material, which lowers the student's chances of remembering anything (as described in Muller's
  video.) While memorization will always be a reality for students, there are ways to do it in a way that is congruent with our knowledge
  of how people learn. There could be a greater focus on the background information, which will give students connections to the larger 
  subject. At any rate, memorization needs to be modernized in order to improve the learning experience.
